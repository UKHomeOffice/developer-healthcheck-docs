Combining Squad Healthcheck data alongside quantitative [DORA metrics](https://dora.dev/guides/dora-metrics-four-keys/) data can be used for targeted improvements.

Where a Developer Healthcheck Workshop provides subjective insights, DORA metrics provide objective data on delivery performance.

## Using DORA metrics with Developer Healthcheck Workshops
DORA metrics can be used to complement the Developer Healthcheck Workshops by providing a quantitative measure of delivery.

### Example
A healthcheck workshop may indicate a team feels they are struggling with deployment frequency, DORA metrics can provide concrete data on how often deployments are happening.

In this example, there is a link between the [Easy to Release indicator](/indicators) and the [DORA Deployment frequency](https://dora.dev/guides/dora-metrics-four-keys/) metric.

This can help identify areas for improvement and track progress over time.
