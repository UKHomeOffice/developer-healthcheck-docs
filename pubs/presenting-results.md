After collating and analysing the data, present the key identified themes back to the team.

The themes should be complimented with objectives to improve situations where there are identified issues.

If presenting to a wider delivery team, also include information for how working towards the objective will benefit everyone.

## Example theme
**Theme**: Releasing to production takes manual intervention and is prone to error

**Objective**: Introduce automation to remove manual intervention

**Rationale**: Engineers find releasing to production a poor experience, fixing this will make engineers happy and also mean the releases become less of an "event", enabling faster more frequent releases which will also be a positive outcome for; Product, Delivery, business stakeholders, and end users.

## Presenting quantitative scores
When presenting the quantitative scoring, presenting in a table can work well. Recording the RAG score allows for the tracking and presenting of trends (improvement/regression) to show how the team is progressing.


### Example table


| **Indicator**    | **RAG outcome** | **Trend from last session** |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| Delivering value | Amber           | Improvement                 |
| Easy to release  | Red             | Regression                  |
