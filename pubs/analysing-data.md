Take the qualitative and quantitative data and analyse the outcomes for themes.

It is likely there will be overlap in discussions, so look for themes across indicators particularly in areas which scored on the lower end of the spectrum on the RAG scoring.

The quantitative data can be used as a high level barometer to identify areas for specific focus, with the qualitative data giving more context to the issues identified.

Aim to draw out a small number of themes which can be used as a short-medium term focus for the team to improve on and work towards ready for a future session.
