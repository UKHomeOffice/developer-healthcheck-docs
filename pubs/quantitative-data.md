The indicators are scored by the team against a Red/Amber/Green (RAG) scale, this allows for quantitative data and a good general overview of how the team feels it is performing against an indicator.

For example in a team of 10 people, there might be 1 person voting Green, 3 Amber, and 6 Red. Clearly in this instance there is a problem in that space, which should be explored through discussion.

Running multiple workshops over a period of time in a long-lived product team you can track movement of scoring, so the next session might see a positive shift but the majority in the Amber â€“ it indicates things might not be perfect, but it's heading in the positive direction.
