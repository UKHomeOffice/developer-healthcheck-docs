## Indicators
Healthcheck workshops allow a team to record both quantitative and qualitative data about how the team feels across several indicators.

The indicators serve as prompts for discussion and also can be scored against a Red/Amber/Green scale.

The indicators of squad health are:

- Delivering value
- Easy to release
- Fun
- Health of codebase
- Learning
- Mission
- Pawns or players
- Speed
- Suitable process
- Support
- Teamwork


## Examples of performance against indicators

| **Indicator**         | **Example of performing well against indicator**                        | **Example of performing poorly against indicator**                                 |

| Mission               | We know why we are here and what we are working towards                 | We have no idea why we are here. There is no clear mission                         |
| Pawns or players      | We decide what to build and how to build it                             | We have no influence over what to build or how to build it                         |
